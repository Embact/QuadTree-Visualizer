# 🌳 QuadTree Visualizer Tool

A lightweight and interactive QuadTree Visualizer built with **HTML Canvas** and **JavaScript** 🖼️⚙️

## 🔍 What is QuadTree?

A **QuadTree** is a tree data structure used to partition a 2D space into four quadrants recursively. It’s widely used in **game development**, **collision detection**, **render optimization**, and **spatial indexing**.

## 🚀 Features

🎯 **Control Points**  
- Adjust the number of points dynamically  
- Enable auto-generate points 🌀  

🧠 **Control Quads**  
- Set the capacity of each quad 🧱  
- Draw quad boundaries to visualize partitions 🔲  

👁️ **Rendering Options**  
- Show/Hide Points 🔴  
- Show/Hide connecting lines between points and their quads or neighbors 📏  
- Enable a **Lens** to detect points inside a rectangular area 🔍  
- Enable **Field of View (FOV)** to render only points inside the lens (Culling / Optimized FPS) 🎥  

⚡ **Collision Detection**  
- Efficiently detect collisions between points inside the same quad 💥  
- No need for O(n²) brute-force — QuadTree partitions handle this for you 🧠  
- Supports up to **10,000 points with real-time collision detection** 🚀

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Canvas API

## 🎮 Real-World Usages

- 🔄 **Game Development** – Spatial Partitioning, Collision Detection, Culling  
- 🌐 **Geographic Mapping** – Managing large map data  
- 🧭 **Search Optimization** – Nearest neighbor queries  
- 📷 **Camera Systems** – Field of view rendering
